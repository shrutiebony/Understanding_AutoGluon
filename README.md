### Exploring AutoGluon
AutoGluon is an open-source Python library that automates the end-to-end machine learning (ML) pipeline. It enables users to build high-performance predictive models with minimal effort, making advanced ML accessible without deep expertise.
AutoGluon provides high-level APIs that simplify:
1) Data Preprocessing (cleaning, handling missing values, feature scaling)
2) Feature Engineering (automatic feature extraction & transformation)
3) Model Selection (choosing the best ML algorithms)
4) Hyperparameter Tuning (automated optimization)
5) Ensembling & Stacking (boosting accuracy using multiple models)
6) Deployment (easy model saving, loading, and inference)

This repository demonstrates different functionalities of AutoGluon through organized project folders. Each folder contains Jupyter/Colab notebooks and scripts showing practical ML tasks across various domains.
